## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

The theme brief for the January 2022 Hackathon was to rethink solutions to help build an iniative to improve different aspects of mental health and well-being in 2022.

The judging criteria:

* Provides a clear and substantial value to the user. 
* Uses an original or innovative idea, design or implementation.
* Has well structured and completed documentation (README and wireframes).
* Is well planned and executed using GitHub projects.
* Focus is realistic and has an overall sense of completeness. 

#### Key information for the site

We discussed several ideas for our project and decided to create a site that would allow the user to record their emotional state daily by choosing the emoji that best depicts how they are feeling. The user would also be able to add a journal entry to expand on their choice of emoji and to note anything they feel is having an effect on their mental health. 

Users would then be able to view their previous emojis on a calendar which would allow them to track their well-being. It would also be a useful tool to be able to show to professionals should the user decide to seek further help. When the user selects an emoji logged in the calendar they would then be shown their journal entry for that day. 

As this would be quite personal information it was important that the user be able to make a profile to keep this information private. By registering a profile the user would then be able to utilise the calendar feature.

When a user selects their emoji we will then provide a personalised recommendation for them based off of the selection they have made. So for example if a user is feeling sad they may be recommended a funny video clip or a positive affirmation, if they are feeling stressed they may receive a video on breathing techniques used to relax or a fun game to play to allow them to destress.

## Strategy

Developed for those who wish to make track their emotional status over time and learn how to control their feelings.

At present, the site is provided with a calendar and a recommendation system. The calendar allows the user to view their previous emotions and the recommendation system allows the user to see a recommendation based on their current emotional state.

Potential advertisers are encouraged to get in touch to offer their articles and service as long as it is in line of sites main idea to serve people as a platform to record, track, and control their feelings.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme for the Website](documentation/design/colourscheme.png)

The main design of the website is based on the colour scheme of the website. The colour scheme is based on the colour scheme of the 2015 American computer-animated film: [Inside Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/) since this file was fundamentally based on 5 core emotions that people may experience in their lives. Therefore, we made a choice not only to use the colours of the film but also to use the images of the main characters of the film.

*More information on this movie you can find on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film))*

Moreover, we researched colour theory and colour psychology to find what colour palettes may be beneficial to someone who may be struggling with their mental health. We discovered that blue are associated with peace, sincerity and gentleness. Darker blues are representative of power, strength and dependability. Greens are associated with growth and have a calming presence.  

We feel that this colour palette has a nice balance between the blues and greens to promote calm and peacefulness on the site. The choice of green also ties in with the use of the colour green in the mental health awareness ribbon.

### Typography

[Main Font: Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/#main-content)

![Roboto](documentation/design/roboto_font_family.png)

- Roboto Google Font was used as the main font of the website in order to increase readability of the content on the pages.

[Accent Font: Rowdies](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rowdies?query=rowd)

![Rowdies](documentation/design/rowdies_font_family.png)

- Rowdies Google Font was used to attract viewers' attention to the company's logo, to make an accent on the strong points of the website, and to incentivize visitors to use our website on a regular basis.

### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

![Home Page Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/homewireframe.png)

* All Pages on the website have:
  * A navigation bar which allows the user to navigate to the home page from every page on the website, and other navigational links.
    - If the user is not logged in, the navigation bar will only have a logo, link to the home page, and get started button.
    ![Navbar image User Logout](documentation/features/navbar.png)
    - if the user clicks on the get started button, they will see a dropdown menu with 2 options: log in or register. After clicking on on of the options, the user will be redirected to the appropriate page.

Profile Page consists:
  - a date in the top left corner to remind the user which day is today and which day they are about to evaluate.
  - a range of emojis to indicate the user's mood.
  - an info button, which will show the instructions on the emojis. When the user clicks on the info button it will open a modal window with instructions on how to use the emojis.
  ![Profile Page image](documentation/features/modal.png).
  - Modal will be closed when the user clicks on the X button or outside of the modal window.
  - It also contains a section with image and a button, which leads to the calendar page.
  - When the user clicks on the chosen emoji, the user will note area, where he or she can add addition notes.
  ![Profile Page image](documentation/features/note_container.png)
  - The user may also choose not to add a note by leaving textarea empty and clicking on the note button to confirm the entry.
  - When the suer submits their entries for a day, the suggestion box will appear. There will be some suggestions for a user to watch, read, or listen to according to the emotions that the user entered for a day.

- If the user didn't left any notes, the user will see a day, emoji, message "You didn't left any notes this day".
![Calendar Page image](documentation/features/no_notes.png)

* Future Implementations.
  * In future implementations we would like to provide the option for a user to be able to change their password or choose to delete their account completely. Moreover, we would love companies to take part of our project to participate in providing high quality suggestions to our users in order to improve their mood and feelings.

### Accessibility

We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Bugs
### Solved Bugs

1. The calendar didn't represent the data of notes when clicking  on the day:

    *Solution:* Add code to calendar.html and calendar.js in order to connect data

      ```javascript
      let dataArray = []
      let emoji_number;
      let tempDate;


      {% for emoji in emoji_tracker %}
      tempDate = new Date({{ emoji.datetime }} * 1000)
      dataArray.push({
        date: tempDate.toLocaleDateString("en-US"),
        emoji: {{ emoji.emoji }},
        note: "{{ emoji.note }}"
      })
      {% endfor %}

      console.log(dataArray)
      ```

1. The babble js functionality didn't work: while clicking on the day number or emoji in the calendar, the 'click' eventListener didn't work.

    *Solution:* Add if statement to target children elements through parent element.

      ```javascript
      if (item.date === e.target.closest("div").dataset.day ||
          item.date === e.target.parentElement.parentElement.dataset.day ||
          item.date === e.target.parentElement.dataset.day
      )

1. Notes notes in the calendar didn't disappear if the user clicked on the day without entries recorded:

    *Solution:* Add code to calendar.html: variable "entriesDates" to store the dates of entries and if statement to check if the date is in the array.

      ```javascript
        if (entriesDates.includes(e.target.closest("div").dataset.day) ||
            entriesDates.includes(e.target.parentElement.parentElement.dataset.day) ||
            entriesDates.includes(e.target.parentElement.dataset.day)) {}
      ```

1. Calendar notes were showing special characters instead of " ' ":
![Calendar Notes](documentation/bugs/typing_bug.png)

    *Solution:* Change textContent to innerHTML.

      ```javascript
        document.querySelector(".note__container--text").innerHTML = `" ${getNote} "`;
      ```
