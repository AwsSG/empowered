## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

The theme brief for the January 2022 Hackathon was to rethink solutions to help build an iniative to improve different aspects of mental health and well-being in 2022.

The judging criteria:

* Provides a clear and substantial value to the user. 
* Uses an original or innovative idea, design or implementation.
* Has well structured and completed documentation (README and wireframes).
* Is well planned and executed using GitHub projects.
* Focus is realistic and has an overall sense of completeness. 

#### Key information for the site

We discussed several ideas for our project and decided to create a site that would allow the user to record their emotional state daily by choosing the emoji that best depicts how they are feeling. The user would also be able to add a journal entry to expand on their choice of emoji and to note anything they feel is having an effect on their mental health. 

Users would then be able to view their previous emojis on a calendar which would allow them to track their well-being. It would also be a useful tool to be able to show to professionals should the user decide to seek further help. When the user selects an emoji logged in the calendar they would then be shown their journal entry for that day. 

As this would be quite personal information it was important that the user be able to make a profile to keep this information private. By registering a profile the user would then be able to utilise the calendar feature.

When a user selects their emoji we will then provide a personalised recommendation for them based off of the selection they have made. So for example if a user is feeling sad they may be recommended a funny video clip or a positive affirmation, if they are feeling stressed they may receive a video on breathing techniques used to relax or a fun game to play to allow them to destress.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme for the Website](documentation/design/colourscheme.png)

The main design of the website is based on the colour scheme of the website. The colour scheme is based on the colour scheme of the 2015 American computer-animated film: [Inside Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/) since this file was fundamentally based on 5 core emotions that people may experience in their lives. Therefore, we made a choice not only to use the colours of the film but also to use the images of the main characters of the film.

*More information on this movie you can find on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film))*

Moreover, we researched colour theory and colour psychology to find what colour palettes may be beneficial to someone who may be struggling with their mental health. We discovered that blue are associated with peace, sincerity and gentleness. Darker blues are representative of power, strength and dependability. Greens are associated with growth and have a calming presence.  

We feel that this colour palette has a nice balance between the blues and greens to promote calm and peacefulness on the site. The choice of green also ties in with the use of the colour green in the mental health awareness ribbon.

### Typography

[Main Font: Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/#main-content)

![Roboto](documentation/design/roboto_font_family.png)

- Roboto Google Font was used as the main font of the website in order to increase readability of the content on the pages.

[Accent Font: Rowdies](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rowdies?query=rowd)

![Rowdies](documentation/design/rowdies_font_family.png)

- Rowdies Google Font was used to attract viewers' attention to the company's logo, to make an accent on the strong points of the website, and to incentivize visitors to use our website on a regular basis.

### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

![Home Page Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/homewireframe.png)
![Log in Page Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/loginwireframe.png)
![Register Page Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/registerwireframe.png)
![Calendar Page Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/calendarwireframe.png)
![Profile Page Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/profilewireframe.png)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a log in page, a registration page, a profile page and a calendar page. Each page of the site has been designed to be fully responsive on a range of devices.

* All Pages on the website have:
  * A navigation bar which allows the user to navigate to the home page from every page on the website, and other navigational links.
    - If the user is not logged in, the navigation bar will only have a logo, link to the home page, and get started button.
    ![Navbar image User Logout](documentation/features/navbar.png)
    - if the user clicks on the get started button, they will see a dropdown menu with 2 options: log in or register. After clicking on on of the options, the user will be redirected to the appropriate page.
    ![Navbar image User Login](documentation/features/navbar_get_started.png)
    - When the user is logged in, the navigation bar will have a logo, a profile button, a calendar button, a log out button, and a link to the home page. After clicking on on of the options, the user will be redirected to the appropriate page.
    ![Navbar image User Login](documentation/features/navbar_user_login.png)
    - On the mobile version of the website, the navigation bar will have a hamburger menu icon which will allow the user to see the navigation options.

![Calendar Page image](documentation/features/no_notes.png)

* Future Implementations.
  * In future implementations we would like to provide the option for a user to be able to change their password or choose to delete their account completely. Due to the time constraints of the Hackathon, this was not a feature required to reach a minimum viable project.

### Accessibility

We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Bugs
### Solved Bugs

1. The calendar didn't represent the data of notes when clicking  on the day:

    *Solution:* Add code to calendar.html and calendar.js in order to connect data

      ```javascript
      let dataArray = []
      let emoji_number;
      let tempDate;


      {% for emoji in emoji_tracker %}
      tempDate = new Date({{ emoji.datetime }} * 1000)
      dataArray.push({
        date: tempDate.toLocaleDateString("en-US"),
        emoji: {{ emoji.emoji }},
        note: "{{ emoji.note }}"
      })
      {% endfor %}

      console.log(dataArray)
      ```

1. The babble js functionality didn't work: while clicking on the day number or emoji in the calendar, the 'click' eventListener didn't work.

    *Solution:* Add if statement to target children elements through parent element.

      ```javascript
      if (item.date === e.target.closest("div").dataset.day ||
          item.date === e.target.parentElement.parentElement.dataset.day ||
          item.date === e.target.parentElement.dataset.day
      )

1. Notes notes in the calendar didn't disappear if the user clicked on the day without entries recorded:

    *Solution:* Add code to calendar.html: variable "entriesDates" to store the dates of entries and if statement to check if the date is in the array.

      ```javascript
        if (entriesDates.includes(e.target.closest("div").dataset.day) ||
            entriesDates.includes(e.target.parentElement.parentElement.dataset.day) ||
            entriesDates.includes(e.target.parentElement.dataset.day)) {}
      ```

### Known Bugs

1. The cal-heatmap calendar is not responsive. There for the user can find it a bit messy, but to reduce misleading for the user, the navigation buttons were implemented

1. The user can only use select - options to pick an emoji as flask can retrieve data of value only from input, select when options are implemented.
